# INDIA-GENERAL-ELECTIONS-RESULT-ANALYSIS-2024-USING-SQL

Project Overview: This project focuses on analyzing the results of the 2024 General Elections in India. It uses SQL queries to manage and analyze data related to constituencies, candidates, political parties, and election outcomes. The goal is to perform detailed analysis and generate insights, such as the total number of seats won by alliances, distribution of votes, and comparison of results across states.

Key Components:

Data Storage:

Various tables are created to store election data, including details of constituencies, results, candidates, and party-wise performance. Tables such as constituencywise_details, partywise_results, statewise_results, and states are used to structure this data.
Election Insights:

SQL queries are designed to extract insights such as:
Total seats available for election.
Seats won by major political alliances, including NDA and I.N.D.I.A.
Party-wise seat distribution in different states.
The margin of victory and the leading/trailing candidates in each constituency.
Data Transformation:

Additional analysis includes modifying the party result tables to classify parties into alliances like NDA, I.N.D.I.A, or others and determining the winning alliance based on total seats.
Specific Analysis:

Detailed queries focus on analyzing the highest votes (EVM and postal) by candidates in each constituency, the breakdown of votes between EVM and postal votes, and the distribution of seats by state.
Additional Metrics:

Queries also provide metrics like the total number of candidates, parties, and vote distribution across regions, particularly for states like Maharashtra.
This project utilizes SQL to handle and process election data, providing a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 elections in India. The outcome includes insights for political analysis and election trends across different states and alliancesâ€‹
